# AnVIL WDL Workflows

WDL workflows for use on AnVIL and other platforms.

- [`fastq_subsample`](https://dockstore.org/workflows/github.com/fhdsl/AnVIL_WDLs/fastq_subsample): subsets, or samples, a fastq.gz file. It currently takes a number of random reads to create a smaller file. This is intended for the purposes of educational activities, creating files for testing, etc.
